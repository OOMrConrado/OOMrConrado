# Hi there, I'm Conrado Gomez

## Fullstack Developer | Turning Ideas into Code

I'm a Software Development and Quality student from Argentina, currently working as a freelance fullstack developer. I believe in bringing imagination to life through code, transforming concepts into functional, beautiful applications.

### What I Do

Currently specializing in fullstack development with a strong backend focus using Python. I enjoy the complete development cycle - from designing user interfaces to architecting robust backend systems.

**Backend:** Python, Flask, MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase  
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
**Tools & Deployment:** Docker, Vercel, Netlify  
**Academic Experience:** C, C#


### Professional Experience

As a freelance developer, I've built custom solutions for clients including:
- Interactive chatbot systems
- Full-stack web applications with comprehensive management systems
- Custom business solutions (client projects under NDA)


### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me strategizing over a chess game or diving into a good book. These activities keep my problem-solving skills sharp and my creativity flowing.


### Current Focus

Actively seeking new opportunities to contribute to innovative projects. While I'm exploring different specializations within software development, my passion lies in backend development with Python, though I remain versatile across the full stack.

### Let's Connect

I'm always open to discussing new projects, collaboration opportunities, or simply talking about technology and development.
